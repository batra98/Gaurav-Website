Hello! I'm Gaurav, a Master's student in Computer Science at [UW-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) (GPA: 3.92/4), specializing in systems, distributed computing, and AI/ML.

I bring over **3.5 years of professional experience** as an AI Platform Engineer at [Couture.ai](https://caistack.com/), where I built scalable MLOps infrastructure, and as an AI intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/), optimizing video compression with deep learning. Most recently, I'll be joining [Sigma Computing](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/) as a Software Engineering Intern in Summer 2025.

I graduated with honors (CGPA: 9.48/10) from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I researched **bandit algorithms** at the [Machine Learning Lab](https://mll.iiit.ac.in/) under [Prof. Naresh Manwani](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/naresh.manwani/), publishing my work at PRICAI'21.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm passionate about gaming. My favorites range from strategy classics like [Age Of Empires](https://www.ageofempires.com/) to action-adventure titles like [Assassin's Creed](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed).

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
