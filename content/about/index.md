Hello! I'm Gaurav, a Master’s student in Computer Science at [UW-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), specializing in backend engineering, distributed systems, and machine learning.

I bring over 3.5 years of professional experience, including impactful roles at [Couture.ai](https://www.couture.ai/) and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/).

I have also worked as a undergraduate researcher at the [Machine Learning Lab](https://mll.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Naresh Manwani](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/naresh.manwani/), where I work on algorithms in the Multi-Arm Bandit Setting.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I’m passionate about gaming. My favorites range from strategy classics like [Age Of Empires](https://www.ageofempires.com/) to action-adventure titles like [Assassin's Creed](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed).

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
