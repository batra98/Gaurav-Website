I’m a first year Master’s student at the [UW-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Systems and Machine Learning.

I aim to apply my strong academic foundation and practical industry experience in
artificial intelligence to drive technological innovation and solve real-world problems.
