I'm a undergraduate researcher, currently completing my bachelors at IIIT, Hyderabad. I'm an honours research student at the [Machine Learning Lab](https://mll.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Naresh Manwani](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/naresh.manwani/), where I work on algorithms in the Multi-Arm Bandit Setting.
