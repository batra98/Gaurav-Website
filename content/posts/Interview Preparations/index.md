This new year, I decided to record my interview prearation journey and hopefully it will help someone like me in the future. So here goes nothing.

## Rubrik Interview

### System Coding Round (Date - 10/01/2022)

<details>
<summary><b>System Coding Round Prepartation Journey</b></summary>

- This round will mainly focus on concurrency and multithreading concepts.
- I have negligible knowledge on these topics. But, I like the challenge
- I have exactly 1 week for preparations, so let's try to make the most of it.

[03/01/2022]

- Awesome post on medium to get started on things: [Rubrik Interview Experience](https://abhinav-prakash.medium.com/rubrik-india-sde-2-interview-experience-72477c72ec8).

- Found a Youtube Playlist: [Bo Quian's Cpp Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL8wkskDlbs&list=PL5jc9xFGsL8E12so1wlMS0r0hTQoJL74M)
- Things learned from the playlist:

  - How to create threads.
  - Achieve syncronization using locks and mutexes.
  - Conditional variables (avoid busy waiting).
  - Future and Options
  - Async functions
  - Packaged Task

- Got basic understanding of concepts. Tommorrow will move on to more practical things.

[04/01/2022]

- Tried solving [Leetcode playlist](https://leetcode.com/problemset/concurrency/) on concurreny.
- Solved the following problems:

* [Complement Base 10](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/): Bit Manuplation

    <details>
    <summary>Cpp Implementation</summary>

    ```cpp

    class Solution {
    public:
        int bitwiseComplement(int n) {

            int x = 1;
            while(x<n)
                x = x*2+1;
            return x^n;

        }
    };

    ```

    </details>

- [Print in order](https://leetcode.com/problems/print-in-order/): Synchronisation using [condition_variable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable) and [mutexes](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/unique_lock).

- Started the [Back to Basics: Cpp Concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riUCrKQ_ezc).
- I could not spend more time today, but will try to spend more time tommorrow.

[05/01/2022 - 06/01/2022]

- I have been chilling a lot. Haven't even completed the previous video.
- Need to devote more time to this.

[07/01/2022-08/01/2022]

- Completed the video series.
- Solved a couple of problems on Leetcode and Lintcode. Some of them are as below:

- Lintcode has a lot of interesting problems, will some more tommorrow.
- Also, remember to give the OA for Schrodinger.

[10/01/2022]
- The interview went good. The interviewer was a nice person. Enjoyed the interview a lot.

[11/01/2022]
- Got a mail for a second round of interviews ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.
- Will start a new thread on that soon.

### System Coding Round - II (Date - 19/01/2022)

<details>
<summary><b> System Coding Round - II Preparation Journey </b></summary>

- This round will be similar to the last round.
- Focus will be on multi-threading and concurrency.
- Need to brush up my skills more and gain more confidence on concepts.

[12/01/2022 - 13/01/2022]
- I did not do much as far as preparation is concerned, maybe I am too lazy ðŸ˜‚.
- But, Now I have a long weekend coming. Will make the most out of it.

[14/01/2022 - 16/01/2022]
- Watched the video series to refresh topics: [Multi-threading in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeSC43KQdVI&list=PL_dsdStdDXbrzGQUMh2sy6T8GcCCst3Nm)
- Solved a couple of good problems on Lintcode. Some of the good ones are:

## Amazon Interview

### ~~Behavioural Interview Round~~ Technical Round [17/01/2022]
<details>
<summary><b>Behavioural Interview Round</b></summary>

- Got an OA from Amazon which was quite easy.
- Received an invite for Behavioural Interview.
- Planning to look at the links provided and some online stuff.

[17/01/2022]
- The interview turned out to be a technical interview ðŸ¥².
- Two questions were asked.
- Was able to code the first one with the most optimal solution that they desired.
- In the second question, was not able to acheive the optimal time complexity which they wanted.
- Will now discuss the questions, my solutions and optimal solutions because:
