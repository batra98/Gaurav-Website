This new year, I decided to record my interview prearation journey and hopefully it will help someone like me in the future. So here goes nothing.

## Rubrik Interview

### System Coding Round (Date - 10/01/2022)

- This round will mainly focus on concurrency and multithreading concepts.
- I have negligible knowledge on these topics. But, I like the challenge
- I have exactly 1 week for preparations, so let's try to make the most of it.

[03/01/2022]

- Awesome post on medium to get started on things: [Rubrik Interview Experience](https://abhinav-prakash.medium.com/rubrik-india-sde-2-interview-experience-72477c72ec8).
- Found a Youtube Playlist: [Bo Quian's Cpp Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL8wkskDlbs&list=PL5jc9xFGsL8E12so1wlMS0r0hTQoJL74M)
- Things learned from the playlist:

  - How to create threads.
  - Achieve syncronization using locks and mutexes.
  - Conditional variables (avoid busy waiting).
  - Future and Options
  - Async functions
  - Packaged Task

- Got basic understanding of concepts. Tommorrow will move on to more practical things.
