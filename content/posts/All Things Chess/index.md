# All things related to Chess


In this blog, I will try to show some interesting games that I play or come across.


## About my chess journey
____

I hated the game of chess when I was a child. It was too embarrassed to lose games in 4-5 moves.

But last year, when covid hit the whole world, along with it the chess bug hit me. After following Samay Raina and cosequently getting to know other awesome chess enthusiasts/players, I once again decided to try my hands at chess.

Here, I will try to document the ups and downs in my chess journey. Hope you enjoy the ride with me üòä.
