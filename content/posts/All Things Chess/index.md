# All things related to Chess

In this blog, I will try to show some interesting games that I play or come across.

## About my chess journey

---

I hated the game of chess when I was a child. It was too embarrassed to lose games in 4-5 moves.

But last year, when covid hit the whole world, along with it the chess bug hit me. After following Samay Raina and cosequently getting to know other awesome chess enthusiasts/players, I once again decided to try my hands at chess.

Here, I will try to document the ups and downs in my chess journey. Hope you enjoy the ride with me üòä.

I have planned to showcase a game, which I felt was best on a particular day.

- In this game, I play as black and win. Later, when I analysed I found out that I was at a massive disadvantage.
- I won the game only because I was too aggressive.
- Lesson learnt: Need to think before I play as playing aggressive can force the opponent to commit mistakes at my level but I wouldn't work in higher rating rounds.
