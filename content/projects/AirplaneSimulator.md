It is a 3D emulation of a jet fighter plane game built in OpenGL. This game was made as a part of the Graphics Course.
This game has been developed keeping the physics involved in airplane movement in mind and supports multiple [camera angles](https://github.com/batra98/Airplane_Simulator/blob/master/gifs/Camera_angles.gif).
