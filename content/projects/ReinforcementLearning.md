In this project, I have used **Monte-Carlo  Methods** and **Temporal Difference Learning** on couple of games and toy problems.
- Trained an agent that plays the [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/haje01/gym-tictactoe) using Monte-Carlo Methods.
- Trained an agent that generates the optimal policy through TD-Methods in the [Frozen-Lake Environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/).
- Built a DQN which can play the [cart-pole game](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/).
