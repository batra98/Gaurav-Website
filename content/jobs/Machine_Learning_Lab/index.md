- Authored the paper **"Multiclass Classification under Dilute Bandit Feedback"**, published at **PRICAI'21**.
- Showed that **ML models trained with partial feedback can achieve accuracy comparable to full-feedback methods**.
- Research focused on **classification algorithms in the Bandit and Semi-Bandit Settings** under the guidance of Prof. Naresh Manwani.
- Designed algorithms for multiclass classification under bandit setting with dilute feedback, inspired by the [Banditron](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/papers/ml/banditron.pdf) algorithm.
- Tech Involved: Python, Machine Learning, Bandit Algorithms, Research.
