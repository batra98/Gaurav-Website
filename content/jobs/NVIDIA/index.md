- I worked at Nvidia, as a **Software Intern in the Cloud gaming (GeForce) Team**.
- My work revolved around **designing a Convolutional Neural Network that can prefilter images as a pre-processing step before compression**.
- This Network can be used to preprocess video frames before encoding to reduce the bits-per-pixel required.
- This CNN will ultimately be used as a pre-processing step in the Nvidia Ge-force Network.
- Tech Involved: Tensorflow, Pytorch.
