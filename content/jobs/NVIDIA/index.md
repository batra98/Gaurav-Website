- I worked at Nvidia, as a **Software Intern in the Cloud gaming (GeForce) Team**.
- My work revolved around **designing a Convolutional Neural Network that can prefilter images as a pre-processing step before compression**.
- This CNN will ultimately be used as a pre-processing step in the Nvidia Ge-force Network.
- Achieved a **15% improvement in PSNR scores and a 10% increase in SSIM metrics**, outperforming traditional JPEG methods. Reduced bits-per-pixel for video encoding, ensuring consistent frame rates even under limited bandwidth conditions.
- Tech Involved: Tensorflow, Pytorch.
